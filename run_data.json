I arrived and immediately felt the energy; people were buzzing about potential collaborations and innovative ideas aiming to tackle some of the world\u2019s pressing issues.\n\nThe workshops were particularly enlightening. I sat in on \"Can Cash Transfers Save Lives?\" presented by Edward Miguel. It sparked an in-depth discussion about the tangible impacts of financial aid, shifting our focus towards real-world applications rather than abstract theories. This kind of practical evidence is what we need more of in our community.\n\nIn smaller group discussions, I was impressed by how freely attendees shared their experiences and insights on global catastrophic risks. Buck Shlegeris led a session on mitigating misalignment risk that laid bare the technical intricacies and yet, they communicated it with such clarity that even novices could grasp the importance.\n\nNetworking was, of course, a key component. I connected with committed individuals from diverse backgrounds, many passionately pursuing initiatives in global health, animal welfare, and policy advocacy. We exchanged ideas, and, more importantly, contacts for future collaboration. This is where the power of community shines; it\u2019s not just about individual efforts but collective impact.\n\nMoreover, I couldn\u2019t miss the effective careers workshop by Abigail Hoskin. Not just for job seekers, it provided insights on how to cultivate an impactful career aligned with our values, encouraging attendees to rethink their professional trajectories with purpose.\n\nFinally, the atmosphere of shared anxiety, hope, and determination fostered an urgency to act. Each conversation I had deepened my understanding of how interconnected our efforts are and how vital it is to support one another in this journey.\n\nOverall, the experience was much more than just attending sessions; it was about harnessing the power of community to inspire action, share knowledge and ignite changes in our respective spheres. Those who didn't apply missed out, and I strongly encourage them next time."

The event was a hub for discussions, networking, and workshops tailored to address pressing global challenges. \n\nLeading up to it, I researched effective altruism materials and figured out how to apply these concepts to my biology studies. At the conference, I engaged in workshops about career paths related to global health and climate change, while also learning from influential speakers like Edward Miguel and Circe McDonald. The talks on global health and catastrophic risks really resonated with me.\n\nNetworking was essential; I met individuals focusing on similar causes, which could lead to future collaborations or mentorships. I also attended a specific session on employing cash transfers in enhancing global health, which sparked some ideas on how to incorporate economics into my bio studies.\n\nOverall, I left with actionable insights for my studies and clarity on applying effective altruism principles in practical settings. The experience was invaluable, and it\u2019s definitely influencing my academic and career trajectory."

At EAGxBerkeley, my primary focus was on the dialogue surrounding effective altruism and how we, as a community, can maximize our impact on pressing global issues. \n\nI attended several workshops that covered a range of cause areas, including global health, catastrophic risks, and animal welfare. For instance, Edward Miguel's presentation on cash transfers in Kenya was particularly enlightening \u2014 the evidence he presented was compelling in demonstrating how effective cash transfers can drive substantial change in poverty-stricken areas. It's fascinating to see empirical data being immensely practical.\n\nI also participated in discussions on global catastrophic risks, where speakers like Jeffrey Lewis delved into nuclear risk management strategies. The intersection of technological advancement and existential risk is one that demands urgency and rigorous thought. \n\nThe networking opportunities were abundant. I engaged with a diverse group of individuals who, despite their varied backgrounds, shared a common goal: to apply their skills towards bettering the world. It was invigorating to connect with like-minded people and exchange ideas on effective career paths within the realm of altruism.\n\nAs someone who critiques faith-based systems, I find it intriguing how effective altruism operates as a kind of secular moral framework. The analytical and evidence-based approach resonates with me, although I remain skeptical of any claim that suggests there is a one-size-fits-all solution to the world\u2019s problems.\n\nOverall, the event was formative \u2014 a mix of intellectual challenge and inspiring motivation. I left with a greater clarity on how to channel my academic knowledge into actionable outcomes, while also considering how we might bring philosophical rigor into the discussions around ethics and altruism. The exploration of these ideas continues to invigorate my work in philosophy, and I encourage anyone to engage with these perspectives, regardless of their faith or belief system."

As an advocate for social justice, I gravitated toward sessions that powerfully connected the themes of effective altruism with pressing social issues. \n\nOne of the standout sessions was on global health, where Edward Miguel illuminated the potential of cash transfers in alleviating poverty in Kenya. It was a reminder that economic empowerment is often the first step to breaking the cycle of exploitation and injustice that remains pervasive within marginalized communities. The discussions didn't just scratch the surface; they dove deep into the systemic roots of inequality.\n\nI attended workshops that fostered collaboration and strategic thinking, like the one led by Abigail Hoskin from 80,000 Hours. We explored how to align our careers with social impact, a topic that resonates strongly in my journey. This isn't just about personal trajectories; it's a call to arms for all of us to interrogate the moral foundations of our professional choices.\n\nWhat cannot be understated is the networking I engaged in \u2014 meeting again with like-minded activists, policy-makers, and others committed to tackling catastrophic risks, including climate change and AI safety. We shared stories \u2014 not just data and research, but real lived experiences \u2014 which is critical in crafting narratives that evoke empathy and drive action.\n\nThroughout the conference, I kept reflecting on accessibility and representation. Lighthaven's limitations prompted vital conversations around inclusivity. It underscored a core belief: the movement for social justice must envelop everyone. We cannot claim to advocate for the collective good if some voices are systematically excluded.\n\nWhen I returned home, I felt an invigorating commitment to integrate the rich discussions, insights, and stories from EAGxBerkeley into my advocacy work. Knowledge shared is potential unlocked. The challenge now lies in translating that potential into concrete, effective action for a more equitable world."

There were workshops and presentations covering topics from global health to animal welfare and catastrophic risks\u2014essentially, the biggest challenges our world faces.\n\nI attended a session by Edward Miguel, who presented on cash transfers in Kenya. It sparked a lot of discussion around the tangible impact interventions can have. I realized how crucial it is to have evidence-based approaches in charitable work. I also got to hear from organizations that are addressing major issues, like nuclear risk and biosecurity, which are often neglected in mainstream discussions.\n\nNetworking was key; I connected with several like-minded individuals, each dedicated to making a difference. Some were already working in impactful organizations, while others were just starting their journeys, like me. We shared ideas and resources, which I found incredibly valuable.\n\nOne of the elements I appreciated most was the focus on career paths. The 80,000 Hours workshop helped attendees, including myself, map out our future opportunities in a way that aligns with effective altruism. They really emphasize long-term impact, and it's a philosophy that resonates with me deeply.\n\nOverall, the conference reinforced the importance of prioritizing my efforts and maximizing the good I can do.

It really drove home the point that, as entrepreneurs, we have a responsibility to not only navigate our industries but to also consider the broader implications of our work on society as a whole.\n\nIn small group gatherings, I shared experiences with individuals from diverse backgrounds. We exchanged ideas about the challenges and ways we all face self-doubt in our professions, especially in an era where we constantly question our choices and impacts.

I participated in several sessions, each designed to not only inform but also facilitate engagement among attendees.\n\nOne particularly enlightening session was \"Can Cash Transfers Save Lives?\" where Edward Miguel provided a wealth of evidence on the effectiveness of financial assistance in improving health outcomes in underserved populations. I also found the discussions on global catastrophic risks intriguing, especially the insights shared by researchers addressing AI safety and nuclear risk.\n\nNetworking was a significant aspect as well. I connected with professionals who are equally passionate about effective altruism, sharing ideas, resources, and potential collaboration opportunities. These connections were invaluable for mutual growth and exploration of impactful initiatives.\n\nWorkshops like \"80,000 Hours Career Workshop\" were aimed at aligning career paths with effective altruism principles. They were critical for attendees looking to make informed decisions about future roles in the community.\n\nI left the conference with a clearer understanding of how various cause areas interlink and how local community building plays a pivotal role in addressing global challenges. It was a reminder that effective altruism isn't just a theory; it's a call to action that we, as a community, must answer.\n\nOverall, I returned invigorated and ready to continue my efforts in fostering local initiatives that strive toward making concrete changes in our world."

In just two days, I managed to absorb an impressive amount of knowledge from leaders in effective altruism and sustainable living.\n\nI attended a rather engaging presentation on cash transfers and their efficacy in global health, presented by Edward Miguel. The evidence he shared from Kenya was a powerful case for rethinking conventional aid methods. This sort of practical application is crucial in shaping how we approach sustainable solutions.\n\nI also participated in a workshop by Abigail Hoskin from 80,000 Hours. It was a no-nonsense session focused on effective careers\u2014how to align your skill set with impactful jobs. It\u2019s critical for anyone looking to make a difference to strategize their career path, and this workshop was invaluable for that.\n\nNetworking was also a significant part of the conference. I connected with fellow attendees who share my passion for fast-tracking sustainable living initiatives. Conversations spanned everything from global catastrophic risk mitigation to animal welfare advocacy. Hearing diverse perspectives reinvigorated my commitment to promoting sustainable practices both on the podcast and in my daily life.\n\nOne of the most sobering yet essential topics discussed was the current state of nuclear risk. It's not just an abstract concern\u2014it\u2019s very real, and we need to act smartly and collaboratively. \n\nLastly, I relished the palpable enthusiasm of both newcomers to effective altruism and seasoned advocates. This mix compels everyone to step up their game and contribute to substantial change. \n\nConferences like these are critical. They not only foster connections but also challenge us to rethink our strategies in promoting sustainability. If you didn't apply, you should have. Don't miss the next one."

EAGxBerkeley 2024, with its meticulously structured agenda designed to ignite deep conversations about our greatest challenges\u2014an intellectual feast and a mirage of radical solutions.\n\nI navigated through sessions that wielded more gravitas than I expected. Edward Miguel dished out hard-hitting evidence about cash transfers in Kenya. It was highly compelling. There\u2019s empirical power in numbers, but one must also wonder: do we risk cheapening human life to abstract statistics? Is it not a curious paradox that in saving lives, we also question the very fundamentals of dignity?\n\nCirce McDonald introduced human challenge trials for Hep C\u2014sounds great on paper, right? Yet, who do we become when we treat vulnerability as a commodity? We danced dangerously close to the ethics of sacrifice for discovery. As noble as it may seem, there\u2019s a gritty realism that one cannot sidestep. I appreciated the courage of Sam Anschell discussing global aid champions; however, I am left pondering the nature of champions in a world hunched under the weight of systemic failures.\n\nNetworking? Oh, the dizzying array of faces, all spinning tales of altruism and dogged determination. I conversed with young individuals eager to change the world. Yet, somehow, their aspirations seem fragile\u2014so easily overshadowed by the enormity of global catastrophic risks like biosecurity and AI safety, illustrated grippingly by Buck Shlegeris and Jeffrey Lewis. What is this, if not mere intellectual posturing? Talk is primitive, action requires a sort of alarming recklessness that we often shy away from.\n\nAnd don't get me started on animal welfare. The plight of farmed animals weighs heavily on my conscience. Lewis Bollard\u2019s rhetoric hit hard; his passion tangible\u2014but is it enough? Righteous indignation seldom fills bellies or alleviates suffering. It's a testament to the complexity of impact; can compassion ever fully convert into measurable change? \n\nIn workshops led by Abigail Hoskin, discussing career paths that align with effective altruism, I grappled with the delicate equilibrium between personal ambition and the broader moral imperative. We might preach the importance of impactful careers, but do we frankly tell them about the existential dread that often shadows these paths?\n\nI left Berkeley invigorated yet inundated with questions. EAGxBerkeley was not just a conference; it was a reckoning. One must always seek potent answers, but is our ability to observe, converse, and critically analyze sufficient to spur the change we seek? The audacity of existence requires more than theory; it demands radical action spurred by sincere compassion\u2014a difficult conversation for a day that\u2019s supposed to end with a free t-shirt."

I attended workshops, notably the one on cash transfers and their impact on health outcomes led by Edward Miguel. The empirical evidence provided was compelling and highlighted the practicality of effective altruism in real-life application.\n\nNetworking was another key component. I connected with individuals from diverse backgrounds, exchanging ideas and experiences about our shared commitment to making a positive impact. It was a convergence of passion and intellect, a reminder that social change thrives on collaboration.\n\nOne session that stood out was on global catastrophic risks, where speakers like Buck Shlegeris presented insights into mitigating misalignment risks in AI development. It provoked thought about the existential challenges we face and the importance of being proactive rather than reactive.\n\nI also participated in several small group discussions. These intimate settings fostered deep dives into specific topics, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of effective altruism's multifaceted approach to problem-solving.\n\nOverall, the conference reinforced the significance of community and shared knowledge in the pursuit of a better world. Details matter; those connections forged and insights gained have the potential to ignite action beyond just personal ideation. EAGxBerkeley was not merely an event; it was a catalyst for future endeavors in effective altruism."

Engaging with like-minded individuals was refreshing\u2014and critical\u2014in pushing forward my goal of establishing a renewable energy research center.\n\nWhat struck me was the profound interconnectedness of health and environmental policies; that reinforced my belief that the center I envision should embody a multisectoral approach. The event highlighted the necessity of collaboration among various groups to address profound systemic issues, and I made sure to follow up with several attendees post-conference.\n\nOverall, the experience was immensely productive. I gathered information, made connections, and solidified my understanding of how to best contribute to the renewable energy landscape moving forward.

The conference will focus on a diverse range of cause areas, local community building, and knowledge sharing. It will offer networking, workshops, presentations, and small group gatherings for attendees dedicated to addressing some of the world's greatest challenges.\n\nApplication details\nApplications are now closed!\nDeadline: September 1, 2024, 23:59 Pacific Time.

We hope that EAGxBerkeley will bring together people who are new to effective altruism and those who are already highly engaged with the movement. If you are new, here are some ways to become involved with EA:\n\nEngage with introductory EA material via a virtual fellowship or independent reading. You may also be interested in the EA Forum, 80,000 Hours, or some of these books.\nMeet EAs in your local community or online.\nThink about your future career plans and how they fit into making the world a better place in some way.\nTips for applying:\n\nYou don't have to complete the above items before submitting your application. We welcome applicants who are in the process of familiarizing themselves with EA and can communicate 1) their understanding of effective altruism and 2) why they would like to get involved.\nIf you have any prior experience or demonstrable interest in global health and wellbeing, animal welfare, or global catastrophic risks (e.g., biosecurity, AI safety, extreme climate change, nuclear weapons), it would be a good idea to highlight it in your application.\nEAGxBerkeley is organized especially for EA communities in the Bay Area and the Western USA. We will prioritize applicants from this region, but we are also open and happy to host people from the rest of the United States or even internationally.\n\nWe recognize the importance of diverse backgrounds, and especially encourage individuals from groups that have historically been underrepresented to apply:\n\nSchedule\nMore detailed information on the agenda, speakers, and content will be available closer to the conference via Swapcard and updates to this webpage.

There are many aspects about this space that we are excited about, but one significant challenge is the lack of existing accessibility for individuals with disabilities affecting physical mobility.\n\nIf you would like to attend this conference and have accessibility requests, please email us at berkeley@eaglobalx.org. You don't have to email us when applying, and may wait until registering for the conference to do so."

One of the highlights was Edward Miguel's talk on cash transfers in global health, which really opened my eyes to evidence-based approaches to aid.\n\nI also participated in a networking session where I met people with similar passions, and we shared ideas about impactful careers. It was encouraging to connect with like-minded individuals who are also trying to make a positive impact in the world.\n\nIn workshops, I learned about navigating career paths related to effective altruism, which helped me think about how my skills align with high-impact opportunities.\n\nOverall, it was a great mix of learning and networking, and I left feeling inspired and more informed about how to engage with the global challenges we\u2019re all passionate about tackling. Definitely an experience I would recommend!"
